## Please consider

### Request already exists

Before making a feature request, please read through the [existing requests](https://github.com/jbunke/tdsm/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Arequest%2Cfeature) to see whether the feature has already been requested or is already in development. If so, you are better off upvoting the existing request, which will give it a higher development priority.

### Bug rather than feature

If your request is to have a problem with the program fixed, please file a [**bug report**](https://github.com/jbunke/tdsm/issues/new/choose) instead of a feature request.
