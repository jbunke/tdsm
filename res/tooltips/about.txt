"Top Down Sprite Maker" is a pixel art character creation
tool developed by Jordan Bunke (Flinker Flitzer).

Its modular design both (1) gives you, the user, full control
over how you want to customize your characters and configure
their sprite sheets for use in your own games or other projects,
and (2) makes TDSM easily extensible. Expect the program to be
frequently updated with additional sprite styles and animations!
