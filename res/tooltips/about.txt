"Top Down Sprite Maker" is a pixel art character creation
tool developed by Jordan Bunke (Flinker Flitzer).

Its modular design gives you, the user, full control over
how you want to customize your characters and configure
their sprite sheets for use in your own games/projects.

It also makes TDSM easily extensible. Expect the program to
be frequently updated with new sprite styles and animations!
