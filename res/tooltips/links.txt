"Stipple Effect" is my scriptable pixel art editor. If you
want to get the most use out of TDSM and do post-processing
on your exported sprite sheets like mapping them to palettes
or enabling or disabling individual customization layers, I
recommend you give Stipple Effect a try.

Additionally, TDSM is source-available software. Help me to
swash bugs or simply read through the code if you're curious!
