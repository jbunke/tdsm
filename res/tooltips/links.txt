"Stipple Effect" is my scriptable pixel art editor.
If you want to get the most out of TDSM and do post-
processing on your exported sprite sheets like mapping
them to palettes or enabling or disabling individual
customization layers, consider trying Stipple Effect.

TDSM is source-available software. Help me swash bugs
or simply read through the code if you're interested!
