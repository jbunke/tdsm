Color selections are used to assign customizable color components, such as skin
color, hair color, or the color of an item of clothing.

Color selections can provide a pre-determined set of colors - "swatches" - to
choose from. Providing no swatches will automatically populate a color selection
with 12 default swatches of various colors.

Randomizing a color selection will randomly assign its color to one of its swatches.

Additionally, color selections may or may not allow for the assignment of any RGB
color, even if it is not among the color selection's swatches. For color selections
that permit this, it can be done by using the color matrix or inputting the color's
hex code in the appropriate textbox and clicking "Submit".
