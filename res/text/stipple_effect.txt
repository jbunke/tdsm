"Stipple Effect" is a pixel art editor made by the same
developer as "Top Down Sprite Maker". It is designed to
encourage the use of scripts to automate tasks. If you
are interested in making your own sprite styles for TDSM,
or modifying existing ones, "Stipple Effect" is the best
program for the job.

Additionally, layer-separated sprite sheet exports from
TDSM can only be viewed and edited in "Stipple Effect",
as these are exported as ".stip" project files.
