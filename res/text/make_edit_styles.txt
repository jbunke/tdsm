Huge news!
Sprite styles can now be created, edited, distributed, and uploaded to TDSM.

In previous versions of TDSM, the available sprite styles were hard-coded into
the program's source code. Now, sprite styles are housed in archives (a single
".zip" or ".tdsm" file). This archive houses a manifest file that defines the
style's customization and assembly logic - including animations and layers - and
any of the sprite styles base assets.

This allows you to:

> Easily modify existing sprite styles, like adding hairstyles or clothing options
> Create a sprite style of your own from scratch. Make sprite styles as simple
      or complex as you like with full control over sprite customization and
      assembly logic.
> Distribute your sprite styles online by simply uploading the archive
