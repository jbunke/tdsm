"Top Down Sprite Maker" gives users a large degree of control to configure sprite
sheets.

Configuration is split into three categories: padding, sequencing, and layout.

Padding

    By default, the size of individual frames in the exported sprite sheet is
    derived from the default sprite size set by the sprite style. However, this
    can be overridden by padding or cropping pixels along each edge. Users can
    export sprite sheets with individual frames ranging from 1x1 pixels to 128x128
    pixels.

    To crop rather than pad, simply input a negative integer in one of the edge
    fields.

    Note that:
    > Cropping edges may cut off pixels with non-transparent contents
    > All frames/sprites in an exported sprite sheet have the same dimensions

Sequencing

    Users can determine which of a sprite style's directions and animations to
    include in an exported sprite sheet, and in which order.

    For example, if a sprite style is 8-directional (N, NW, NE, W, E, SW, SE, S)
    and includes the animations "idle", "walk", "run", "hurt", "jump", but the
    user intends to export a sprite sheet for an NPC in a game with a movement
    system that is 4-directional, they may wish to only export the directions
    N, W, S, and E, and only export the animations "idle" and "walk".

Layout

    Layout deals with how frames/sprites are arranged in the exported sprite
    sheet. Users can determine whether animations should be sequenced vertically
    or horizontally. Directions will be sequenced along the complementary axis.
    Additionally, users may determine whether multiple animations should be
    sequenced in a single row/column and more.
