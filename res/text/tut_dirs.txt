Directions, along with animations and layers, are one of the fundamental building
blocks of a sprite style in "Top Down Sprite Maker". A sprite style must declare which
directional system it implements.

At present, sprite styles can support:
> 4 directions (N, W, S, E)
> 6 directions (N, NW, NE, S, SW, SE)
> 8 directions (N, NW, NE, W, E, SW, SE, S)

Users can use the arrows in the preview panel to turn the current customization
around. They may also determine which directions to include in the export (and
in which order) on the Configuration screen.
