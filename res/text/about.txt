"Top Down Sprite Maker" (TDSM) is a pixel art character
creation tool developed by Jordan Bunke (Flinker Flitzer).

Its modular design gives you, the user, full control over
how you want to customize your characters and configure
their sprite sheets for use in your own games/projects.

TDSM also allows users to make their own sprite styles,
either by modifying existing ones or starting from scratch!
