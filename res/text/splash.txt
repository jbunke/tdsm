Buy "Stipple Effect"!

You can rearrange the order in which directions and
animations are sequenced in exported sprite sheets

You can constrain sprite randomization by locking
customization layers that you don't want to modify

Animations are efficient with their frames. A walk
cycle may be four frames long, but only represented
as three frames in a pong loop because two frames
in the cycle are the same.
