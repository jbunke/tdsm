Locking a layer excludes it from randomization. This is an effective strategy for
constraining randomization.

Constraining randomization means to control certain variables and characteristics
of a customization. When such layers are locked, their value will persist when
the sprite style is randomized. For example, if you want to randomize a sprite
style, but you want the hairstyle, hat, and skin color to remain the same, you can
simply lock those layers and click the die in the top-right corner. The result
will be a newly randomized set of traits, but those defined by locked layers will
remain the same.
