"Top Down Sprite Maker" provides some options on export.

The program always exports the sprite sheet as a flattened PNG image. In addition
to this, users may export the sprite sheet's metadata as a JSON file, and may
export a version of the sprite sheet with layers separated as a "Stipple Effect"
project.

JSON metadata

    Exporting a sprite sheet's metadata has a few potential uses. The metadata
    includes information about the ID of each animation frame and its position
    in the sprite sheet, the sprite style, customization choices, as well as
    configuration settings.

    The JSON can be passed to a game engine to automatically split and tag the
    sprites in the associated sprite sheet.

    It can also be re-uploaded to "Top Down Sprite Maker" to load that character
    back into the program, provided the same sprite style (or a sprite style with
    the same ID and all the same layer IDs and customization choices as outlined
    in the JSON) is present in TDSM.

"Stipple Effect" project

    The layer-separated "Stipple Effect" project can be used to modify the sprite
    sheet. For example, you can disable a particular clothing layer to create a
    variation of your sprite that is shirtless.
